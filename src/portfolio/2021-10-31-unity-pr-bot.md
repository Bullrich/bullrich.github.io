# Unity Cloud Status Check

GitHub status check which takes Pull Request and starts a Unity Cloud Build.

After the build is finished, it reports the result as either a successful check or a failing one with details.

The technologies used here are:
- Svelte
- Typescript
- GitHub api (Octokit)
- Firebase
    - Functions are used to trigger events between the two systems.

You can see the app here: [https://unityprbot.com](https://unityprbot.com)
