# Actions-Github

This project is a complete port of the [@actions/github](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/github) project used to build GitHub actions.

The code was ported from **Typescript** into **Rust**.

I also took a lot of time of providing a very detailed [documentation](https://docs.rs/actions-github/) with many examples.
