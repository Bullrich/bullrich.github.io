# Polkadot Testnet Faucet

I [developed](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-testnet-faucet/pull/204) the [Polkadot Testnet Faucet UI](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-testnet-faucet/).

Originally, it was an element bot that could only be used by logged in users.
After comparing other alternatives in the ecosystem and interacting with all the stakeholders, I lead a project to generate a website, with designers and marketing.

This faucet has been forked and repuporsed by other companies, like the [Avail faucet](https://faucet.avail.tools/) or the [Frequency Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.frequency.xyz/)
