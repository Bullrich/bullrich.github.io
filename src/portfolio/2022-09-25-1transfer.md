1Transfer is a `dApp` that provides a **zero hassle** single push **multi-transfer** system.

It supports multiple chains and every single ERC20 token running on that chain.

It was built to handle [floating point number divisions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/types.html#fixed-point-numbers) which can be challenging topic in the Solidity scenario.

It was built for the [ETH Global]([https://online.ethglobal.com/](https://online.ethglobal.com/)) hackathon.

## How it's Made

This project runs on three chains, Mainnet, Polygon, and Optimism, and supports any kind of ERC20 token on any of the deployed networks (including AAVE and Cronos)

It uses ENS to show the name of the username if it's available and it is deployed in Valist.

Hardhat was used to develop the smart contract, which is thoroughly tested.

The landing page is plain HTML and the client was built using Svelte.

Tailwind and Daisy UI were used for developing the UIs
