At Jamcity I was a platform engineer, developing plugins in native code for the mobile platforms (Java, Objective-C and JS), 
develop backend services and was part of an international team mantaining the core libraries and the backend systems. 
We worked with every kind of technology, doing front, back, CI and even QA-Automation.
