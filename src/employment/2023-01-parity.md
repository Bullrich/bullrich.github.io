I used to work at Parity, the company that develops the blockchain [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/).

I was working in the Engineering Automation team, building tools that improve the organization of the company
and provide quality of life improvements to the developers.

I did several things, like the [Review-Bot](/portfolio/review-bot.html) or the [Polkadot Testnet Faucet](/portfolio/polkadot-testnet-faucet.html)
