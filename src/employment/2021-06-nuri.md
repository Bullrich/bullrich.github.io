I used to work at Nuri (ex Bitwala), the new reality of banking, as a Senior Software Engineer. I worked on a mix of mobile, 
frontend, and serverless backend. After one year I moved into the newly created Platform Team where I worked 
on automating most of the pipeline, helping both developers and DevOps.
