Today I took my third COVID-19 shot, the booster one.

It was a bit after the announcement that [Austria will require vaccines to not be older than 9 months](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/austria-to-shorten-validity-of-vaccination-certificates-from-12-to-9-months-starting-on-december/), hence it is becoming a requirement.

And probably other countries will request it soon, so it's better to get it now.

Now, Berlin has been quite packed. I went earlish in the morning to the Tegel Vaccination Center but got lost. I usually use the app called [Transit](https://transitapp.com/), which, in my opinion, is one of the best apps for public transport navigation. But in this particular case it failed and made me take a different route that didn‘t make sense. At the end I lost 30 minutes coming back and taking a different route.

Once I arrived I had to do a line outside with the people without appointments (it seems that appointments are super hard to get so I opted in for the wait). Now, a funny thing of Berlin: The weather is _always_ ugly and of course it was raining. Someone from security was handing plastic ponchos which became a blessing.

On total we waited for 2 hours and 20 minutes just to get inside the building (which, lucky for me, was the exact duration of _The Hobbit, Battle of Five Armies_ so I wasn‘t that bored during the line.

Once inside the process was quite quick, in less than 15 minutes my data was collected and I got vaccinated and ready to go.

So now I‘m tripled vaccinated. I have WI-FI everywhere I go.
