description: Gamification of the Multitier architecture
---
This game is a literal representation of [Multitier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture), a type of client–server architecture.

There is not a single rigidbody in the whole game. I took as a challenge to write up my own physics, make my own pixel art and program it using the multitier architecture.

You play as a user request send by the user, and must hack your way through.
